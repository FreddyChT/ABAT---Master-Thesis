Instrumentation chain :
-----------------------
   - Probe              : B-PNEU-SS
   - Sensor             : Scanivalve MPS4264 - 1PSI
   - DAS                : Scanivalve MPS4264 - 1PSI
   - Sampling frequency : 300 Hz
   - Sampling time      : 3 s

   
Reference system :
------------------

-  z/H    : Normalized spanwise distance from the endwall
-  x/C_ax : Normalized axial location (PS coordinate is negative to distinguish from SS)
-  S/S_l  : Normalized location along the PS or SS surface length (PS coordinate is negative to distinguish from SS)

Reference :
-----------

- Ps/P01  : time-averaged static pressure measured by the sensor normalized by the freestream total pressure at plane 01 obtained with correlation
