Instrumentation chain :
-----------------------
   - Probe              : B-HF
   - Sensor             : Hot-films / Anemometer (Dantec Dynamic Streamline Pro CTA)
   - DAS                : NI6253-USB
   - Sampling frequency : 1.2 MHz
   - Sampling time      : 3 s

Reference system :
------------------

-  z/H    : Normalized spanwise distance from the endwall
-  x/Ca_x : Normalized axial location (PS coordinate is negative to distinguish from SS)
-  S/S_l  : Normalized location along the PS or SS surface length (PS coordinate is negative to distinguish from SS)

Comments :  Negative values correspond to position on the pressure side
