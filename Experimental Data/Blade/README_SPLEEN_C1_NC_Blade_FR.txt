Instrumentation chain :
-----------------------
   - Probe              : B-FR
   - Sensor             : Kulite sensor
   - DAS                : NI6253
   - Sampling frequency : 1.2 MHz
   - Sampling time      : 3 s

Reference system :
------------------

-  z/H    : Normalized spanwise distance from the endwall
-  x/C_ax : Normalized axial location (PS coordinate is negative to distinguish from SS)
-  S/S_l  : Normalized location along the PS or SS surface length (PS coordinate is negative to distinguish from SS)

Reference :
-----------

- Ps/P01 	: time-averaged static pressure measured by the sensor normalized by the freestream total pressure at plane 01 obtained with correlation
- STDP/P01  	: standard deviation of static pressure signal measured by the sensor normalized by the freestream total pressure at plane 01 obtained with correlation
- SKEWP/P01  	: skewness of static pressure signal  measured by the sensor normalized by the freestream total pressure at plane 01 obtained with correlation
- KURTP/P01  	: kurtosis of static pressure signal  measured by the sensor normalized by the freestream total pressure at plane 01 obtained with correlation
