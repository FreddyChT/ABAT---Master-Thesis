Instrumentation chain :
-----------------------
   - Probe              : P-PNEU-BL-01 (BLT)
   - Sensor             : Scanivalve MPS4264
   - DAS                : Scanivalve MPS4264
   - Sampling frequency : 300 Hz
   - Sampling time      : 3 s

Reference system :
------------------

-  z/H    : Normalized spanwise distance from the endwall
-  y/g    : Normalized pitchwise location
-  x/C_ax : Normalized axial location

Reference :
-----------

- P0_BL/P01 	: Total pressure measured by boundary layer probe (BLT) normalized by the freestream total pressure at plane 01 obtained with correlation
- P0_BL/Ps1w 	: Total pressure measured by boundary layer probe (BLT) normalized by the pitchwise averaged static pressure measured with endwall taps at Plane 01
