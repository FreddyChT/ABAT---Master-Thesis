Instrumentation chain :
-----------------------
   - Probe              : P-FR-4H-01 
   - Sensor             : Kulite sensor
   - DAS                : NI6253
   - Sampling frequency : 1.2 MHz
   - Sampling time      : 3 s

Reference system :
------------------

-  z/H    : Normalized spanwise distance from the endwall
-  y/g    : Normalized pitchwise location
-  x/C_ax : Normalized axial location

Reference :
-----------

- d 		: outlet flow deviation in deg (definition of angles in "SPLEEN-HSTC-DB-MeasurementTechniques_vX")
- Pitch 	: Pitch angle at inlet of cascade in deg (definition of angles in "SPLEEN-HSTC-DB-MeasurementTechniques_vX")
- rho 		: Local density measured by L5HP in Kg m-3
- V_ax 		: Local axial velocity measured by L5HP in m s-1
- P06/P01	: Local total pressure measured by L5HP at Plane 06 normalized by the freestream total pressure at plane 01 obtained with correlation
- Ps6/P01	: Local static pressure measured by L5HP at Plane 06 normalized by the freestream total pressure at plane 01 obtained with correlation

Comments :
----------
- Computation of d : Deviation[deg] = Flow angle [deg] - Metal angle at the outlet [deg]

- Metal angle at the outlet [deg] = 53.8
