Instrumentation chain :
-----------------------
   - Probe              : P-FR-4H-01 
   - Sensor             : Kulite sensor
   - DAS                : NI6253
   - Sampling frequency : 1.2 MHz
   - Sampling time      : 3 s

Reference system :
------------------

-  z/H    : Normalized spanwise distance from the endwall
-  y/g    : Normalized pitchwise location
-  x/C_ax : Normalized axial location

Reference :
-----------

- k 		: Turbulent kinetic energy
- TI_mean       : Turbulence intensity computed with FRV4HP, using time-averaged local absolute velocity
- ILS           : Integral length scale estimated with FRV4HP

Comments:
---------

- Users of the database are warned about the measurements performed with the FRV4HP in the absence of the WG. The measurements display a behavor that is not physical and therefore should be used with caution. 
The turbulent quantities should be normalized by the midspan value and adimensionalized with the correct value of turbulence intensity measured with a hot-wire probe (~2.40%).
